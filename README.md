# Strava2Notion
Development of a Python application for the management and administration of Strava sports information and its automatic storage in the Notion application.

## Local installation

If desired, the code can be executed locally. To do this we must first clone the repository or download the code with the following command:

For a Windows operating system
```bash
gh repo clone PabloLHo/Strava2Notion
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once cloned, it will be necessary to fill in the user data for a correct use of notion and strava accounts and their APIs. You will be able to obtain the information to fill in these fields correctly in the following document associated with it.

Finally, once the application is complete for convenience, it is suggested to create a specific .exe file for its execution. For this purpose the auto-py-to-exe library has been used.

By means of the following commands we will be able to obtain the executable to be able to use this program when we require. We must open the command console and execute the following instructions:
```bash
pip install auto-py-to-exe
auto-py-to-exe
```
Once it has been executed, a window will open to fill in the data for the creation of the executable. The most important data to fill in will be:

* The location of the main file main.py
* If you want an executable in a folder or as a single file.
* Select the command console execution

In addition to this we will be able to give other data like selecting an icon as the one located in the resources folder or giving a name to the generated executable as well as indicating its output directory.

## Development

The development of this project starts from the practice of a subject of Computer Engineering at the University of Jaén called Algortimos Geométricos, the code base of the interface is developed by the professors Lidia Ortega Alvarado, Alfonso Lopez Ruiz. As an addition to the initial work, a series of practices were developed and can be found in the following [repository](https://github.com/PabloLHo/Geometricos.git).

For the development of the data structure with tree format, we first developed the **2D format** where, given a cloud of points, we subdivide the points that are ordered by axes until we have only one left to generate a leaf. As divisors, we generate segments with the origin of the cutting point in the plane generated by the tree and as an end a point outside the range of the camera, except for cases that generate an intersection with another segment.

The development of the **3D-Tree** was very similar, as it was only necessary to abstract to a third dimension to be considered for the partitions, in addition, it was necessary to move to the use of dividing planes instead of segments. As a plane is infinite, its complexity was reduced to square polygons in order to deal with those cases that can produce intersection after multiple divisions as well as for a better visualisation from the observer's position.

### Database populated with data
First we will present an example of the creation and visualisation of a **2D point cloud**.

After this is displayed on the scene, we can generate the associated KD-Tree using the step-by-step format or a direct and complete creation, the result is shown below.
